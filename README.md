# üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è Chili-Based Recipes üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è

# Recipe ETL Script

## Overview

The script reads a JSON file containing recipes data, identifies recipes with "Chilies" (including likely misspellings) in their ingredients, adds a "difficulty" field based on preparation and cooking times, cleans the data and saves the filtered recipes into a CSV file.

To retrieve the CSV file, you need to run the main.py file! This will then output the CSV into the 'data' folder within this repository.


## Features

- Extracts recipes with "Chilies" from a JSON dataset and converts this to a cleaned pandas dataframe.
- Using a function to translate the prepTime and cookTime columns into minutes, calculates the 'difficulty' level of each recipe.
- Creates a new 'difficulty' field based on these time durations.
- Those recipes with missing values in prepTime or cookTime have an 'Unknown' difficulty.
- Outputs the filtered recipes into a CSV file, which is automatically saved in the 'data' folder in this repository
